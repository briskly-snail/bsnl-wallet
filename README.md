> Important: our enhanced **briskly-snail wallet** works with the same contract at **0x3f243F1A635b3E55249222dAB9529441f5A2d594**


## ROADMAP

Our interpretation is that Takeshi wished to decentralize his work.

We look to: 

1. Revive or build a community around Takeshi's original work (*in progress*)
2. Engage with community by providing explanation and support (*in progress*)
2. Enhance the wallet with new functionality (*planned*)
 - For example, calculate and allow claiming of rewards based on the "hodling" interest rate (the main way to earn with the SNAIL token)
3. Add DeFi
 - Add additional DeFi functionality around the original SNL ERC20 token by Takeshi
 - Build upon the protocol
 

## About

**Brisky-snail** is a further continuation and development of the original wallet to work with the SNaiL tokens. Original project has been published [on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/takeshikodo/snl-wallet) in 2019 (before the topic of DeFi has become massively popular).

It seems that ideas of Takeshi's work has already affected other projects. We believe his work is applicable in the modern context for DeFi to grow intrinsically and should be continued.


## Quote from the original README

> SNL (non-exclusively) stands for "Satoshi Nakamoto Leverage" or the SNaiL token.

> The idea is to program a crypto asset with controllable or lesser liquidity. Such asset would be more inert or have a "slower" market behavior by design. As a result token becomes more resilient to the significant volume movements, which are typical for the large scale "pump and dump" speculations. Over time, token may exhibit predictable inflation rates, comparable to FIAT. Such token can be a reasonable investment choice purposed for the "storage of value".

> Simple mechanism mentioned above can be programmed to operate completely "in silico". Our hope is that the published smart contract can help crypto markets to become self-sufficient, in the same time potentially render any complex human-supervised market regulations as superfluous.

> One can use the wallet app to buy, sell or transfer SNL directly via the contract, which is an extended version of the ERC20.

- openzeppelin-solidity 2.3.0

Also see package.json

### Install solidity (Mac)

Install or upgrade solidity:

Install node_modules with:

    yarn

and start a local dev server with:

    yarn dev
